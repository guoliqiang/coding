Summary of CGDB
***************

CGDB is a curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB).  The goal
of CGDB is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with
unnecessary features.

   The interface is designed to deliver the familiar GDB text
interface, with a split screen showing the source as it executes.  The
UI is modeled on the classic Unix text editor, vi.  Those familiar with
vi should feel right at home using CGDB.

   The library responsible for communicating with GDB is called Trivial
GDB (tgdb, or more accurately, libtgdb).  This abstraction allows the
UI code to be independent of the debugger, as well as greatly
simplifying its implementation.

   Those wanting to develop other interfaces to GDB are welcome to use
libtgdb as the basis for their program.  Many of the headaches of
parsing GDB's output and annotations can be avoided by using it.

   Some features offered by CGDB are:

   * Syntax-highlighted source window

   * Visual breakpoint setting

   * Keyboard shortcuts for common functions

   * Searching source window (using regexp)

1 Getting In and Out of CGDB
****************************

This chapter discusses how to start CGDB, and how to get out of it.
The essentials are:
   * type `cgdb' to start CGDB.

   * type `quit' or `C-d' in the GDB window to exit.

   * type `:quit' in the source window to exit.  This even works if GDB
     is currently hanging, or operating a long command.

2 Understanding the core concepts of CGDB
*****************************************

The CGDB user interface currently consists of two windows and a status
bar.  The source window is currently on the top and the GDB window is
on the bottom.  The "status bar" currently separates the two windows.

   The interface has several modes depending on which window is focused.
"CGDB mode" is when the source window is focused, "GDB mode" is when
the GDB window is focused and "TTY mode" is when the TTY window is
focused.

   Beginning with CGDB version 1.0, the windows are movable, and the
user will be able to create as many or as few that is desired.
Currently however, all of my time is spent developing the interface
between CGDB and GDB. Once this is complete, the UI of CGDB will become
much more polished.  If you are a ncurses developer, and have spare
time to work on this task, please contact me.

2.1 Understanding the source window.
====================================

The "source window" is the window that provides you a view of the source
code that the debugged program is made up of.  It will display to the
user a single source file at a time.  While the user is debugging, via
`next' and `step', CGDB will update the source file and line number to
keep you informed as to where GDB is debugging.

   CGDB has several features that make debugging easier than using
plain old GDB.  One feature you will notice right away while debugging
a C, C++ or ADA program, is that the source files are syntax
highlighted.  This allows the user to easily navigate through the
source file to look for certain places in the source code.  If you
would like to see another source language highlighted, contact us.  To
understanding how to navigate through the source window look at the
commands in *note CGDB Mode::.

   In addition to showing the source code, CGDB also displays to the
user the currently executing line. The line number will be highlighted
green, to represent that the particular line, is the current line being
debugged by GDB.  Also, CGDB will display an arrow extending from the
line number, to the source line.  You can configure what type of arrow
CGDB uses with the `:set arrowstyle' configuration option. By default,
the `short' arrow is used.  However, my personal favorite is the `long'
arrow.

   As you navigate through the source window, the current line the
cursor is on will be highlighted white.  This simply helps you keep
track of where you are in the file.

   Also, you can set or delete breakpoints in CGDB from the source
window.  Simply navigate to the line that you are interested in setting
a breakpoint, and hit the space bar.  This will set a breakpoint on the
line if one did not already exist.  The line number should turn red to
indicate that a breakpoint has been set.  Hitting the space bar again
will delete the breakpoint.  If you disable the breakpoint, the line
number will turn yellow, to represent the disabled breakpoint.

   CGDB also supports regular expression searching within the source
window.  If you type `/' or `?' you can search in the source window for
a string of interest.  The C library regular expression functions are
used to perform this search, which honors things like `*' or `+'.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note CGDB Mode::.

2.2 Understanding the GDB window.
=================================

The "GDB window" is how CGDB allows the user to interface with the GNU
debugger.  If you wish to pass a command to GDB, simply type it into
this window and GDB will receive the command.  This interface is
intended to be 100% identical to using GDB on a terminal.

   There is a limited set of keys that can be typed into this window
that CGDB interprets and handles, instead of sending to GDB.  They are
all available in *note GDB Mode::.

   CGDB attempts to buffer commands the same way they would be if you
typed them at the terminal.  So, if you type several commands before a
single one finishes, they will each be run in order.  There will be no
way to stop these commands from being run besides from typing `Ctrl-C',
like you would at any normal terminal when working with GDB.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: File Dialog Window,  Next: TTY Window,  Prev: GDB Window,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.3 Understanding the file dialog window.
=========================================

The "file dialog window" is available to help the user view and select
which file they would like to view.  It provides the user with a list
of all the files that make up the program being debugged.  If there are
no files available, because there is no program being debugged or
because there is no debug symbols, then the file dialog will not open
and a message will be displayed at the status bar.

   You can get to the file dialog by hitting `o' when you are at the
source window.  Once you enter the file dialog, it is possible to leave
it by hitting `q'.  You can navigate the file dialog using the standard
direction keys and you can even use regular expression to find your
file.  This can save a lot of time as the number of files grow.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note File Dialog Mode::.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: TTY Window,  Next: Status Bar,  Prev: File Dialog Window,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.4 Understanding the TTY window.
=================================

The "TTY window" is available to allow the user to pass input to the
program being debugged. This window will act similar to the GDB window,
except that the data you type will get sent to the program being
debugged.  *Note Sending I/O to Inferior::.

   You will notice that the TTY window has a terminal device between it
and the program being debugged.  So, if the program being debugged uses
say readline, which allows command line editing, the same interface
will be provided via the TTY window as at the terminal.  You can see
the name of the terminal device in the TTY status bar.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note TTY Mode::.

   Sending I/O to the program being debugged can be confusing.  It is
described better in *note Sending I/O to Inferior::.  Unless the I/O
with the program being debugged is simple, I usually prefer starting
the application on a separate terminal and attaching to it with CGDB.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: Status Bar,  Next: Switching Windows,  Prev: TTY Window,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.5 Understanding the status bar.
=================================

The "status bar" is the general purpose way for CGDB to show the user
which commands they are currently typing or report errors to the user
when they occur.  CGDB does not use popup's or other forms of I/O to
alert the user of information or problems.

   While CGDB is running, you can configure it with any of the commands
that are valid in CGDB's configuration file.  Simply type `:' in the
source window, and you will see the colon, and the rest of the command
you type appear in the status bar.  When you are finished typing the
command that you are interested in, type `enter'.  This will alert CGDB
to execute the command.  If at any point you would like to cancel the
current command typed so far, type the cgdb mode key.  This will put
you back into CGDB mode.  For a description of the cgdb mode key, see
*note Switching Windows::.

   The full list of commands that are available in the source window is
in *note Configuring CGDB::.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: Switching Windows,  Prev: Status Bar,  Up: Understanding CGDB

2.6 Switch between windows
==========================

When CGDB is invoked, the interface is in "GDB mode".  A `*' at the
right of the status bar indicates that input will be passed to GDB.  To
change the focus to the source window, hit the <ESC> key.  The "cgdb
mode key" is the key that is responsible for switching the user into
"CGDB mode" from a different mode.  The cgdb mode key is defaulted to
the <ESC> key.  To change this value, look at the configuration options
for CGDB.  *Note Configuring CGDB::.

   The interface is now in "CGDB mode".  To switch back into "GDB mode",
press `i'.  This syntax is based on the popular Unix text-editor, vi.

3 CGDB commands
***************

CGDB can be controlled in a variety of different ways.  Each mode that
CGDB is in acts differently. Currently CGDB implicitly changes modes
depending on which window is active.  The following information will
help you determine what commands are accessible during which modes.

* Menu:

* CGDB Mode::                   Commands available during CGDB mode
* GDB Mode::                    Commands available during GDB mode
* File Dialog Mode::            Commands available during the file dialog mode
* TTY Mode::                    Commands available during TTY mode


File: cgdb.info,  Node: CGDB Mode,  Next: GDB Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.1 Commands available during CGDB mode
=======================================

When you are in the source window, you are implicitly in "CGDB mode".
All of the below commands are available during this mode.  This mode is
primarily available for the user to view the current source file,
search it, or switch to a different mode.

`cgdbmodekey'
     Puts the user into command mode. However, you are already in this
     mode.  This is defaulted to the <ESC> key.

`i'
     Puts the user into "GDB mode".

`I'
     Puts the user into "TTY mode".

`T'
     Opens a window to give input to the debugged program.

`Ctrl-T'
     Opens a new tty for the debugged program.

`k'
`up arrow'
     Move up a line.

`j'
`down arrow'
     Move down a line.

`h'
`left arrow'
     Move left a line.

`l'
`right arrow'
     Move right a line.

`Ctrl-b'
`page up'
     Move up a page.

`Ctrl-u'
     Move up 1/2 a page.

`-'
     Shrink source window 1 line.

`='
     Grow source window 1 line.

`_'
     Shrink source window 25% (or, shrink tty window 1 line, if
     visible).

`+'
     Grow source window 25% (or, grow tty window 1 line, if visible).

`Ctrl-l'
     Clear and redraw the screen.

`F5'
     Send a run command to GDB.

`F6'
     Send a continue command to GDB.

File: cgdb.info,  Node: GDB Mode,  Next: File Dialog Mode,  Prev: CGDB Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.2 Commands available during GDB mode
======================================

When in "GDB mode", the user is mostly interested in working with the
GDB console.  That is, sending commands to GDB and receiving data back
from GDB.  Almost all data passed into this window is directly sent to
readline and then to GDB.

   It is important to understand that CGDB parses the keys entered in
the GDB window and has the first chance at dealing with them.  If it is
interested in the keys, it will handle them. Below is a list of keys
that CGDB is interested in, and does not pass along any further.

`cgdbmodekey'
     Switch back to source window.  This is defaulted to the <ESC> key.

`page up'
     Move up a page.

`page down'
     Move down a page.

`F11'
     Go to the beginning of the GDB buffer.

`F12'
     Go to the end of the GDB buffer.

   Any other keys, besides the ones above, CGDB is currently not
interested in.  CGDB will pass along these keys to the readline
library. When readline has determined that a command has been received,
it alerts CGDB, and a command is then sent to GDB. This is the same
method used when invoking GDB directly.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: File Dialog Mode,  Next: TTY Mode,  Prev: GDB Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.3 Commands available during the file dialog mode
==================================================

The file dialog is primarily used to allow the user to find and open a
source file that the program they are debugging is made up of.  The
file dialog will be full screen, and will list each file that the
debugged program is made up of.  A usual instance of the file dialog
would be to open it up from the source window using the `o' key, and
then to search for the file of interest. If you are looking for foo.c
type `/foo.c', press `enter' once to finish the regular expression and
again to select the file.

   The commands available in the file dialog are:

`q'
     Will exit the file dialog, and return to the source window.

`k'
`up arrow'
     Move up a line.

`j'
`down arrow'
     Move down a line.

`h'
`left arrow'
     Move left a line.

`l'
`right arrow'
     Move right a line.

`Ctrl-b'
`page up'
     Move up a page.

`Ctrl-f'
`page down'
     Move down a page.

`/'
     search from current cursor position.

`?'
     reverse search from current cursor position.

`n'
     next forward search.

`N'
     next reverse search.

`enter'
     Select the current file.


File: cgdb.info,  Node: TTY Mode,  Prev: File Dialog Mode,  Up: Controlling CGDB

3.4 Commands available during TTY mode
======================================

`cgdbmodekey'
     Switch back to source window. This is defaulted to the <ESC> key.

`page up'
     Move up a page.

`page down'
     Move down a page.

`F11'
     Go to the beginning of the GDB buffer.

`F12'
     Go to the end of the GDB buffer.

4 CGDB configuration commands
*****************************

There may be several features that you find useful in CGDB.  CGDB is
capable of automating any of these commands through the use of the
config file called `cgdbrc'.  It looks in `$HOME'`/.cgdb/' for that
file.  If it exists, CGDB executes each line in the file in order.  It
is as if the user typed in all the commands into the status bar after
the tui was initialized.

   The following variables change the behavior of some aspect of CGDB.
Many of these commands may be abbreviated in some way, and all boolean
commands my be negated by appending `no' to the front.  For example:
`:set ignorecase' turns on case-insensitive searching; while `:set
noignorecase' turns on case-sensitive searching.

`:set as=STYLE'
`:set arrowstyle=STYLE'
     Set the arrow style to STYLE.  Possible values for STYLE are
     `short', `long', and `highlight'.  Changes the style of the arrow
     that is used to indicate the currently executing line in the source
     viewer.  The default value is short.  A longer arrow is available,
     for easier readability.  Finally, the `highlight' option draws no
     arrow at all, instead drawing the entire line in inverse video.

`:set asr'
`:set autosourcereload'
     If this is on, CGDB will automatically reload a source file if it
     has changed since CGDB has opened it.  If it is off, the file will
     never be reloaded, until you start CGDB again. The default is on.
     This feature is useful when you are debugging a program, then you
     modify a source file, recompile, and type `r' in GDB's CLI window.
     The file in this case will be updated to show the new version.
     Note, CGDB only looks at the timestamp of the source file to
     determine if it has changed. So if you modify the source file, and
     didn't recompile yet, CGDB will still pick up on the changes.

`:set cgdbmodekey=KEY'
     This option is used to determine what key puts CGDB into "CGDB
     Mode".  By default, the `ESC' key is used.  KEY can be any normal
     key on the keyboard.  It can also be any keycode, as long as the
     keycode notation is used.  This option is especially useful when
     the user wants to use readline in vi mode.  If the user types `set
     cgdbmodekey=<PageUp>' then the `Page Up' key will put CGDB into
     CGDB mode and the `ESC' key will flow through to readline.

`:set ic'
`:set ignorecase'
     Sets searching case insensitive.  The default is off.

`:set stc'
`:set showtgdbcommands'
     If this is on, CGDB will show all of the commands that it sends to
     GDB.  If it is off, CGDB will not show the commands that it gives
     to GDB.  The default is off.

`:set syn=STYLE'
`:set syntax=STYLE'
     Sets the current highlighting mode of the current file to have the
     syntax STYLE.  Possible values for SYNTAX are `c', `ada', and
     `off'.  Normally, the user will never have to do this, since CGDB
     automatically detects what syntax a file should be based on its
     file extension.  However, this feature can currently be useful for
     debugging purposes.

`:set to'
`:set timeout'
     This option is used along with the TTIMEOUT option to determine the
     behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of a mapped key
     sequence or a keyboard code sequence.  If this option is on, CGDB
     will time out on both user defined mappings and on key codes from
     the keyboard.  If this option is off, user defined mappings will
     not be timed out on.  In this case, CGDB will determine if it
     should time out on key codes from the keyboard by examining the
     TTIMEOUT option.  To determine how CGDB will time out on mappings
     and key codes, and what time out lengths CGDB will use, please
     refer to the chart in *note Key User Interface::.  The default
     value for this option is on.

`:set tm=DELAY'
`:set timeoutlen=DELAY'
     This option is used along with the TTIMEOUTLEN option.  It
     represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a
     key code from the keyboard or for a mapped key sequence to
     complete.  If DELAY is 0, CGDB immediately accepts each character
     it receives.  This will prevent any mappings or key codes to
     complete.  DELAY may be any value between 0 and 10000, inclusive.
     The default setting for the DELAY variable is 1000 (one second).

`:set ttimeout'
     This option is used along with the TIMEOUT option to determine the
     behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of keyboard code
     sequence.  If this option is on, CGDB will time out on key codes
     from the keyboard.  If this option is off, CGDB will determine if
     it should time out on key codes from the keyboard by examining the
     TIMEOUT option.  To determine how CGDB will time out on key codes,
     what what time length it will use, please refer to the chart in
     *note Key User Interface::.  The default value for this option is
     on.

`:set ttm=DELAY'
`:set ttimeoutlen=DELAY'
     This option is used along with the TTIMEOUTLEN option.  It
     represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a
     key code from the keyboard.  If DELAY is 0, CGDB immediately
     accepts each character it receives.  This will prevent any key
     codes to complete.  DELAY may be any value between 0 and 10000,
     inclusive.  The default setting for the DELAY variable is 100 (one
     tenth of a second).

`:set ts=NUMBER'
`:set tabstop=NUMBER'
     Sets the number of spaces that should be rendered on the screen
     for <TAB> characters.  The default value for NUMBER is 8.

`:set wmh=NUMBER'
`:set winminheight=NUMBER'
     The minimal height of a window.  Windows will never become smaller
     than this value.  The default value for NUMBER is 0.

`:set winsplit=STYLE'
     Set the split point between source and GDB window.  This is
     especially useful as an init setting in your `cgdbrc' file.  *Note
     Configuring CGDB::.  The possible values for STYLE are `top_full',
     `top_big', `even', `bottom_big', and `bottom_full'.

`:set ws'
`:set wrapscan'
     Searches wrap around the end of file.  The default is on.

`:c'
`:continue'
     Send a continue command to GDB.

`:down'
     Send a down command to GDB.

`:e'
`:edit'
     reloads the file in the source window.  this can be useful if the
     file has changed since it was opened by cgdb.

`:f'
`:finish'
     Send a finish command to GDB.

`:help'
     This will display the current manual in text format, in the
     "source window".

`:hi GROUP cterm=ATTRIBUTES ctermfg=COLOR ctermbg=COLOR term=ATTRIBUTES'
`:highlight GROUP cterm=ATTRIBUTES ctermfg=COLOR ctermbg=COLOR term=ATTRIBUTES'
     Set the COLOR and ATTRIBUTES for a highlighting group.  The syntax
     mimics vim's "highlight" command.  Possible values for GROUP,
     ATTRIBUTES and COLOR are available in *note Highlighting Groups::.

     You can give as many or as few of the name=value pairs as you
     wish, in any order.  `ctermfg' and `ctermbg' set the foreground
     and background colors.  These can be specified by color number or
     by using the same color names that vim uses.  When CGDB is linked
     with ncurses, the number you use to represent the color can be
     between -1 and COLORS.  When CGDB is linked against curses, it
     must be between 0 and COLORS.

     `cterm' sets the video attributes for color terminals.  `term' sets
     the video attributes for monochrome terminals.  Some examples are,
          :highlight Logo cterm=bold,underline ctermfg=Red ctermbg=Black
          :highlight Normal cterm=reverse ctermfg=White ctermbg=Black
          :hi Normal term=bold

`:insert'
     Move focus to the GDB window.

`:n'
`:next'
     Send a next command to GDB.

`:q'
`:quit'
     Quit CGDB.

`:r'
`:run'
     Send a run command to GDB.

`:start'
     Send a start command to GDB.

`:k'
`:kill'
     Send a kill command to GDB.

`:s'
`:step'
     Send a step command to GDB.

`:syntax'
     Turn the syntax on or off.

`:up'
     Send an up command to GDB.

`:map LHS RHS'
     Create a new mapping or overwrite an existing mapping in CGDB mode.
     After the command is run, if LHS is typed, CGDB will get RHS
     instead.  For more details on how to use the map command look in
     *note Using Maps::.

`:unm LHS'

`:unmap LHS'
     Delete an existing mapping from CGDB mode.  LHS is what was typed
     in the left hand side when the user created the mapping.  For
     example, if the user typed `:map a<Space>b foo' then the user
     could delete the existing mapping with `:unmap a<Space>b'.

`:im LHS RHS'
`:imap LHS RHS'
     Create a new mapping or overwrite an existing mapping in GDB mode.
     After the command is run, if LHS is typed, CGDB will get RHS
     instead.  For more details on how to use the map command look in
     *note Using Maps::.

`:iu LHS'

`:iunmap LHS'
     Delete an existing mapping from GDB mode.  LHS is what was typed
     in the left hand side when the user created the mapping.  For
     example, if the user typed `:imap a<Space>b foo' then the user
     could delete the existing mapping with `:iunmap a<Space>b'.

5 CGDB highlighting groups
**************************

CGDB is capable of using colors if the terminal it is run in supports
them.  Until version 0.6.1, CGDB did not allow the user to configure
these colors in any way.  CGDB color use is now fully configurable.

   CGDB's modeled its use of color highlighting after vim.  Any data
that will be colored in the terminal is represented by a highlighting
group.  A "highlighting group" represents data that should be formatted
using foreground colors, background colors and attributes.  There are
currently several types of highlighting groups in CGDB.  There are
syntax highlighting groups, which represent syntax highlighting of
sources files.  There are also User Interface groups, which represent
things like CGDB's logo, or the status bar.

   Each highlighting group has a default set of attributes and colors
associated with it.  You can modify a highlighting groups properties by
using the highlight command.  *Note Configuring CGDB::.

   Note that CGDB currently supports using the same background color
the terminal was using before CGDB was started.  However, this only
works when CGDB was linked with ncurses.  If you link CGDB with curses,
then CGDB will force the background to Black.

5.1 The different highlighting groups
=====================================

Below is a list of all the highlighting groups that CDGB will use when
syntax highlighting source files.

`Statement'
     This represents the keywords a language defines.

`Type'
     This represents the types a language defines.

`Constant'
     This represents either a string or numeric value.

`Comment'
     This represents the comments in a source file.

`PreProc'
     This represents the C/C++ preprocessor commands.

`Normal'
     This represents all normal text.

   Below is a list of all the highlighting groups that CGDB will use
when it is displaying it's User Interface.

`StatusLine'
     This represents the "status bar" in CGDB.  The file dialog's status
     bar also uses this group.

`IncSearch'
     This represents the group used when the user is searching in
     either the source window, or the "file dialog window".

`Arrow'
     This represents the arrow that CGDB draws to point to the
     currently viewed line.

`LineHighlight'
     This represents the group used when the user has the `arrowstyle'
     option set to `highlight'.

`Breakpoint'
     This represents the group that is used when CGDB displays a line
     that has a breakpoint set.

`DisabledBreakpoint'
     This represents the group that is used when CGDB displays a line
     that has a disabled breakpoint set.

`SelectedLineNr'
     This represents the group that is used when CGDB is displaying the
     currently selected line.  This is the line that the cursor is on.

`Logo'
     This is the group CGDB uses to display its logo on startup when no
     source file can be auto detected.

5.2 The different attributes
============================

CGDB supports many of the attributes that curses provides.  It will
apply the attributes to the output window, but it is up to the terminal
you are using to support such features.

   The list of attributes that CGDB currently supports is below.

`normal'
`NONE'
     This will leave the text normal.  Uses A_NORMAL curses attribute.

`bold'
     This will make the text appear bold.  Uses A_BOLD curses attribute.

`underline'
     This will underline the text.  Uses A_UNDERLINE curses attribute.

`reverse'
`inverse'
     This will reverse the foreground and background colors.  Uses
     A_REVERSE curses attribute.

`standout'
     This is the best highlighting mode of the terminal.  Uses
     A_STANDOUT curses attribute.

`blink'
     This will cause the text to blink.  Uses A_BLINK curses attribute.

`dim'
     This will cause the text to be 1/2 bright.  Uses A_DIM curses
     attribute.

5.3 The different colors
========================

CGDB supports several colors, depending on how many colors your terminal
supports.  Below is a chart of the colors that CGDB provides.  The
heading NR-16 is used to represent terminals that support at least 16
colors.  The heading NR-8 is used to represent terminals that support
at least 8 colors.  The integer values for each color represent the
values passed to the curses function init_pair() to ask curses to
create a new color.

`COLOR NAME'                  `NR-16'        `NR-8'         `NR-8 bold

6 CGDB key user interface
*************************

The Key User Interface is how CGDB receives input from the user.  It is
usually referred to as the "KUI".  CGDB simply asks the KUI for the next
key the user typed and the KUI will provide it.

   The KUI has 2 major responsibilities besides reading normal user
input and providing it to CGDB.  It needs to detect when the user has
typed a user defined map or when the user has hit a special key on the
keyboard.

   A user defined map, or simply "map", is used to change the meaning
of typed keys.  Some users may refer to this type of functionality as a
"macro".  An example would be `map a b'.  If the user then typed the
<a> character, the KUI would detect that it was mapped to <b> and
return <b> to CGDB.

   When the user types a special key on the keyboard, a "key code" is
sent to CGDB.  Typically, keys like  `HOME', `DEL', <F1>, etc, when
pressed will send several characters to the application instead of just
one character like a normal key does.  These characters combined are
called a "key sequence".  The KUI is responsible for assembling the key
sequences back together and reporting to CGDB that a particular key was
typed by the user.  The `ESC' key is special because typically most key
codes start with that key.  This usually gives all key codes a common
first key in its key sequence.  The KUI uses the terminfo database to
determine what key sequences are sent by which keycodes.  There are a
few commonly used key sequences that are hard coded into CGDB.

   A major challenge the KUI has to overcome is determining when a map
or a key sequence is received.  The KUI sometimes will need to read
more than one character to determine this.  For example, if the user
has 2 maps, `map abc def' and `map abd def', the KUI would have to
buffer at least the characters <a> and <b> before it could determine if
the user was going to type a map.  After the next key press, if the
user types <c> or <d> then a map was received and the KUI will return
`d e f' to CGDB.  Otherwise, no map was received and the KUI must return
`a b' to CGDB.

   The options TIMEOUT, TTIMEOUT, TIMEOUTLEN and TTIMEOUTLEN can be
used to tell the KUI if it should timeout on partial mappings or key
sequences, and if so, how long it should wait before timing out.

File: cgdb.info,  Node: Configuring the KUI Time Out Options,  Next: Using Maps,  Up: Key User Interface

6.1 The KUI's time out options
==============================

The KUI may be configured to time out on either maps or key sequences.

   When the KUI is matching a partial map or key sequence it is capable
of timing out.  This means it will simply accepts the keys it has
received so far if a certain amount of time elapses between key
presses.  This is obvious when the user is typing a map because the
user must press each key individually.  For partial key sequences, this
is less obvious.  That is because the user only presses a single key,
but multiple characters are sent to CGDB.  The table below describes
how the user can configure the KUI to time out on key codes or maps.
The TIMEOUT and TTIMEOUT options control this functionality.

timeout     ttimeout    action
--------------------------------------------------------- 
off         off         do not time out
on          on or off   time out on maps and key codes
off         on          time out on key codes

   It is also possible to tell the KUI how long to wait before timing
out on a partial match.  If TIMEOUT is on, then the KUI will wait a
certain amount of time for the next character, when matching a map,
before it decides a match is no longer possible.  If TIMEOUT or
TTIMEOUT is on, then the KUI will wait a certain amount of time for the
next character, when matching a key sequence, before it decides a match
is no longer possible.  The TIMEOUTLEN and TTIMEOUTLEN options can be
configured by the user to tell the KUI how long to wait before timing
out.  The table below describes when the KUI uses which option.

timeoutlen  mapping delay  key code delay
------------------------------------------ 
< 0         TIMEOUTLEN     TIMEOUTLEN
>= 0        TIMEOUTLEN     TTIMEOUTLEN

   A value of 0 means that the KUI will time out right away.  It will
not be possible to match a map or key code in this circumstance.

   A common problem could be that when the user types a special key like
the left or right arrows, CGDB will go into the source mode and not
perform the action requested by the user.  This typically means that the
key code delay is to small.  If you try setting the option `set
ttimeoutlen=1000' CGDB should start acting like the user expects.  If
not, please report this to the CGDB mailing list.

6.2 Using maps
==============

CGDB fully supports the use of maps.  It allows the user to change the
meaning of typed keys. For example, you could have the following map
`:map <F2> ip<Space>argc<CR>'.

   When the user is in CGDB mode and they hit <F2>, the value of the map
will be used instead.  The `i' key will first be received by CGDB, and
it will put the user into insert mode.  Next, CGDB will get `p argc'
followed by the <Enter> key.

   CGDB currently supports two mapping lists.  Any mapping that was
added with the MAP command will be used by CGDB when it is in CGDB mode.
You can delete a mapping that you have created with the MAP command
with the UNMAP command.  If you want to have mappings in GDB mode, you
can use the IMAP command.  Similarly, IUNMAP will delete a mapping in
the IMAP set.  Some examples of this would be
     map a<Space>b foo
     unmap a<Space>b

     imap a<CR>b foo
     iunmap a<CR>b

6.3 Understanding keycodes
==========================

The above example could use a little more explaining for people
unfamiliar with vim maps.  The map takes a key and a value.  They are
separated by a space.  Neither the key or value can have a space in
them, or it is considered to be the separator between the key and
value.  If the user desires to have a space in either the key or value
part of a map, they can use the keycode notation <Space>.  Below is a
table of the keycodes in "keycode notation" form.  The keycode notation
can be used in any mapping command.

notation    meaning
------------------------------------------ 
<Esc>       escape key
<Up>        cursor up key
<Down>      cursor down key
<Left>      cursor left key
<Right>     cursor right key
<Home>      home key
<End>       end key
<PageUp>    page up key
<PageDown>  page down key
<Del>       delete key
<Insert>    insert key
<Nul>       zero
<Bs>        backspace key
<Tab>       tab key
<NL>        linefeed
<FF>        formfeed
<CR>        carriage return
<Space>     space
<Lt>        less-than
<Bslash>    backslash
<Bar>       vertical bar
<F1> -      function keys 1 to 12
<F12>       
<C-...>     control keys
<S-...>     shift keys

7 Sending I/O to the program being debugged
*******************************************

If the program being debugged takes input on the terminal it is
recommended that the user start the program on one terminal, and attach
to it with CGDB from another terminal.  This is the easiest way to pass
input to the debugged program.

   However, if the user wishes to pass input to the program being
debugged from within CGDB, there is a mechanism available for doing so.
As of this writing, the technique described below does not work on
windows, using a natively compiled GDB.  It may work when using the GDB
that comes with Cygwin.

   This technique is similar to getting in and out of "GDB mode".  The
tty window is not visible by default.  This is because it is only
needed if the user wishes to send data to the program being debugged.
To display the tty window, hit `T' while in command mode.  After
hitting `T' you will notice that there is another window in the middle
of the "source window" and the "gdb window".  This is called the "tty
window". You will also see a new status bar called the tty status bar.
There will be a `*' on the tty status bar after the `T' was hit.  This
is because when the window is opened with the `T' command, CGDB
automatically puts the user into "TTY mode".  To get out of this window
hit the cgdb mode key.  This will put you back into command mode.  To
make the tty window appear and disappear hit the `T' key while in
command mode.  It is a toggle.

   Once the tty window is already open, the user can then hit `I' in
command mode to get into "TTY mode".  The user can then hit the cgdb
mode key in the "TTY mode" to get back into command mode.

   When the tty window is open, all data that comes from the program,
goes there.  Any data typed into the tty window will ONLY go to the
program being debugged.  It will not go to GDB. When the tty window is
closed, all output from the debugged program will go to the "GDB
window" AND to the "tty window" (for viewing later when the tty window
is opened).

   If the user wishes to get a new tty for the program being debugged
then they can type `Ctrl-T'.  This will delete all the buffered data
waiting to be read into the debugged program. This might be useful when
you rerun or start a new program.

8 Allowing terminal control flow in CGDB
****************************************

A user can typically set there control flow behavior by using the stty
command like so `stty -ixon -ixoff'.  This will disable control flow on
the terminal where CGDB is started.  If you want to turn control flow
back on you can type `stty ixon ixoff'.  If flow control is on, when
the user types `Ctrl-s', the terminal stops.  When the user types
`Ctrl-q', the terminal restarts.  When using readline, the `Ctrl-s'
character usually does a forward search.  So, if you want to get this,
or other functionality out of readline, simply turn off control flow
and start CGDB.

9 Building CGDB from source
***************************

Building CGDB from source requires several packages. First, CGDB is
hosted at http://sf.net/projects/cgdb. You can determine how to get
CGDB from source by looking here:
http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=72581.

   Once you have the source to CGDB, now you can begin to build it.
You will of course need many packages to build CGDB. Below is a list of
all of them that are required to build CGDB.

`GNU Make'
     I have successfully used version 3.79.1, however, older versions
     probably will work.

`GNU GCC'
     The GNU C compiler. I've compiled CGDB with versions as old as
     2.9.5, and as new as 4.0.2.

`GNU Readline'
     The GNU readline library version 5.1. CGDB will not work with
     versions before 5.1.  Readline was modified specifically to work
     with CGDB.

`GNU Ncurses'
     I have successfully used libncurses.so.5 successfully.  However,
     older versions probably will work.

   Below is a list of optional packages you will need, if modifying
certain files in CGDB.

`GNU Flex'
     If you modify any files with an extension of `.l', you will have
     to have flex installed.  I have used flex 2.5.4 to build CGDB.

`GNU Texinfo'
     If you modify `doc/cgdb.texinfo', then you will be required to
     have this package installed.  I have used version 4.7 to build the
     documentation for CGDB.

`help2man'
     If you are doing a release, then you will be required to have this
     package installed.  In the `doc/' build directory, you can execute
     the command `make cgdb.1', and the CGDB man page will be generated.

   CGDB uses autoconf/automake to build its configure scripts and
makefiles.  So, if you change any of the autoconf/automake files, you
will need this software installed.

`GNU Automake'
     This has the program aclocal, and must be version Version 1.9.5.

`GNU Autoconf'
     This has the program autoconf, and must be version 2.59.

`GNU m4'
     This has the program m4, and must be version 1.4.3.

     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.
